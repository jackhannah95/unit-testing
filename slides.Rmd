## What is unit testing?

- Unit testing involves testing code to ensure it does what it's supposed to do

- It is an important concept in software development

- In the context of R, unit testing normally involves testing whether the output of functions are as expected

- If you've never heard of unit testing, but do write R functions, chances are you already do informal unit testing


## Why do unit testing?

```{r out.width = "85%", fig.align = 'center'}
include_graphics(here::here("images", "pill-test.jpg"))
```
